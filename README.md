# MNIST
Classifying handwritten digit from [MNIST data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). 

The models were tested on the [Kaggle Digit Recognizer competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer). This [program](https://github.com/Thang30/MNIST/blob/master/complex_convolution_NN.py) achieved the best accuracy.
